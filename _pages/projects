# My Projects

Below is a brief about my recent projects.

## Pose Estimation, Categorization and Segregation using Robot Manipulator (POSCAR) \[ [GitHub](https://github.com/thathvik/POSCAR) \]

* Used NVIDIA DOPE to identify the object and estimate its 6D Pose with the image input from a 2D RGB camera.
* Simulated a Robotic arm with a camera near the end-effector to identify the pose of the objects and then move the robotic arm to the pose estimated by DOPE to then manipulate the said objects in the scene.

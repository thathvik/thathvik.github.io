I recently finished my Master's in Mechatronics and Robotics from New York University. Throughout my education I have worked on several projects learning various technologies along the way. During one of my graduate courses by Professor Ludovic Righetti, I have done a project in implementing a push resisting algorithm to control a one-dimensional Linear Inverted Pendulum Model of a Bi-ped. The video below is a demonstration of the results from the project.

I recently finished my Master's in Mechatronics and Robotics from New York Univerity. Throughtout my eduacation I have worked on several projects learning almost a new technology everytime. During my one of my graduate courses by Professor Ludovic Righetti, I have done a project in implementing a push resisting algorithm to control a one dimensional Linear Inverted Pendulum Model of a Bi-ped. The video below is a demonstration of the results from the project.
